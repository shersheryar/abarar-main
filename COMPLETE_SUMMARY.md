## 🚀 Quick Start (All Parts)

### Initial Setup (ONE TIME):
```bash
cd /home/no0ne/Downloads/abarar-main
source venv/bin/activate  # All dependencies already installed!
```

### Run Part A:
```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open: PartA/PartA_rollnumber.ipynb
# Run All Cells - everything works automatically!
```

### Run Part B Task 1:
```bash
# FIRST: Add your road and satellite images to PartB/PartB_dataset/
# THEN: Update filenames in notebook cell 3
jupyter notebook
# Open: PartB/PartB_Task1_rollnumber.ipynb
# Update correspondence points in cell 5
# Run All Cells
```

### Run Part B Task 2:
```bash
# FIRST: Add drone_route.mp4 to PartB/PartB_dataset/
# THEN: Update correspondence points in notebook cell 8
jupyter notebook
# Open: PartB/PartB_Task2_rollnumber.ipynb
# Run All Cells
```
